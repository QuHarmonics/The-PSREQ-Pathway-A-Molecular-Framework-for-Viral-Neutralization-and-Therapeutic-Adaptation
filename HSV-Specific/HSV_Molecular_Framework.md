## Molecular Analysis of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)

### **Introduction**
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a highly pervasive viral pathogen responsible for diseases ranging from cold sores to more severe systemic infections. This repository explores HSV's molecular framework to identify therapeutic targets, employing advanced computational, structural, and biochemical approaches.

### **HSV Molecular Context**

HSV's genome is composed of double-stranded DNA encoding proteins essential for replication, immune evasion, and pathogenesis. The virus consists of the following key components:

- **Capsid Proteins**: Shield viral DNA.
- **Tegument Proteins**: Facilitate early infection processes.
- **Envelope Glycoproteins**: Aid host cell attachment and fusion.

### **Target Proteins**
- **Glycoprotein B (gB)**: Essential for membrane fusion and viral entry.
- **Glycoprotein D (gD)**: Critical for receptor binding and initiating infection.
- **HSV DNA Polymerase**: Central to replication, making it a prime target for therapeutic intervention.

### **Mechanistic Pathways and PSREQ Application**

#### **1. Targeted Binding**
- **PSREQ Peptide Motif**:
  - Binds conserved glycoproteins (gB, gD).
  - Proline residues enable flexibility.
  - Serine and glycine enhance hydrogen bonding.

#### **2. Stabilization**
- Zinc ions (Zn\(^{2+}\)) and magnesium ions (Mg\(^{2+}\)) stabilize the peptide-protein interaction, maintaining efficacy under biological fluctuations.

#### **3. Disruption of Viral Processes**
- **Inhibition of Glycoprotein Functions**:
  - Blocks membrane fusion and viral entry.
- **Replication Interruption**:
  - Disrupts polymerase activity, halting DNA synthesis.
