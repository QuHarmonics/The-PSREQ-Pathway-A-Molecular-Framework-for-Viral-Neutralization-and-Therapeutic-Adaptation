2. **Inhibition of Replication**:  
   - Blocks DNA/RNA polymerase activity in HSV and HIV, halting genome replication.  
   - Prevents assembly of viral particles by destabilizing structural proteins.  

3. **Kinetic and Thermodynamic Alignment**:  
   - Ensures molecular interactions remain stable under biological fluctuations through magnesium ions.
