## Molecular Analysis of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)

### Introduction
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a highly pervasive viral pathogen responsible for diseases ranging from cold sores to more severe systemic infections. The analysis provided here focuses on understanding HSV at the molecular level, with an emphasis on identifying therapeutic targets through chemical, structural, and computational biology insights.

### HSV Molecular Context

HSV's genome is composed of double-stranded DNA, encoding a diverse array of proteins involved in replication, immune evasion, and pathogenesis. Its structural components include:
- **Capsid Proteins**: Protect the viral DNA.
- **Tegument Proteins**: Facilitate early infection processes.
- **Envelope Glycoproteins**: Aid in host cell entry.

Key focus areas for therapeutic intervention include viral glycoproteins such as gB and gD, which play critical roles in cell attachment and fusion.
